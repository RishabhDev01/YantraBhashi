# Yantrabhashi Online Classroom

This project is an interactive web platform for writing, validating, and submitting code written in the Yantrabhashi toy programming language. It provides a full-stack solution with distinct roles for **Students** and **Instructors**, facilitating a learning and feedback loop.

---

## üöÄ Core Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login for both Students and Instructors.
* **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate interfaces tailored to the needs of students and instructors.
* **In-Browser Code Editor**: Students can write and validate Yantrabhashi code directly in the browser.
* **Client-Side Validation**: Instant feedback on syntax and semantic errors using a built-in tokenizer and LL(1) parser.
* **Submission History**: Students can track their past submissions and view instructor feedback.
* **Centralized Review**: Instructors can view all submissions from all students and provide targeted feedback.

## Instructions to Run locally

* MongoDB should be running in local at the URI specified in backend/.env

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/logicthread/YantraBhashi
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd YantraBhashi/
```

Install dependencies and Run Server

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

Install dependencies and Run Frontend

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```


#### For Part 1
Switch to the following branch

```bash
git switch release/part_1
```

run the index.hml file in the browser

## üîÑ System Architecture & Flow

The application is built on a client-server architecture.

### 1. Client-Side (Frontend)
* **User Interface**: Built with **React.js** to create a dynamic and responsive user experience for the login/signup pages, code editor, and user dashboards.
* **Yantrabhashi Validator**: The core logic for validating Yantrabhashi code runs entirely in the browser.
    * **Tokenizer**: Scans the source code and converts it into a stream of tokens (keywords, identifiers, symbols).
    * **Parser**: A recursive-descent LL(1) parser checks the token stream for syntactical and semantic correctness (e.g., variable declarations, type mismatches).
* **API Communication**: When a student submits code, the frontend sends the code along with the validation results (success or error messages) to the server.

### 2. Server-Side (Backend)
* **API Endpoints**: Manages user authentication, processes code submissions, and handles requests for fetching submission data and feedback.
* **Business Logic**: Differentiates between `Student` and `Instructor` roles, ensuring users can only access the data they are permitted to see.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)
* **Users Collection**: Stores user credentials and role information (Student/Instructor).
* **Submissions Collection**: Stores each student's code submission, the validation messages generated by the client, timestamps, and any feedback provided by an instructor.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ User Roles

### Student
1.  **Write Code**: Use the online editor to write programs in the Yantrabhashi language.
2.  **Validate**: Get immediate feedback on errors from the client-side validator.
3.  **Submit**: Send the code and validation output to the server to be stored.
4.  **Review**: View a personal history of all past submissions and read feedback left by instructors.

### Instructor
1.  **Dashboard View**: Access a centralized dashboard listing all submissions from every student.
2.  **Review Submissions**: Select any submission to view the student's code and the original validation output.
3.  **Provide Feedback**: Write and save comments or grades for each submission, which then become visible to the corresponding student.

## üìò Yantrabhashi Language Reference

The validator supports the following language constructs.

### Keywords & Data Types
* `PADAM`: Declare a variable.
* `ANKHE`: Integer data type.
* `VARTTAI`: String data type.
* `CHATIMPU`: Print to output.
* `CHEPPU`: Read user input.
* `ELAITHE`: If condition.
* `ALAITHE`: Else condition.
* `MALLI-MALLI`: Loop construct.

### Example Code
Example 1 ‚Äî Hello World
```
PADAM message:VARTTAI = "Hello World";
CHATIMPU(message);
```

Example 2 ‚Äî Sum of Two Numbers
```
PADAM a:ANKHE;
PADAM b:ANKHE;
PADAM sum:ANKHE = 0;

CHEPPU(a);
CHEPPU(b);

sum = a + b;

CHATIMPU("The Sum is:");
CHATIMPU(sum);
```

Example 3 ‚Äî Conditional

```
PADAM username:VARTTAI;
CHEPPU(username);

ELAITHE (username == "Anirudh") [
CHATIMPU("Welcome Anirudh!");
] ALAITHE [
CHATIMPU("Access Denied!");
]
```

Example 4 ‚Äî Loop with Sum
```
PADAM sum2:ANKHE = 0;

MALLI-MALLI (PADAM i:ANKHE = 1; i <= 5; i = i + 1) [
sum2 = sum2 + i;
]

CHATIMPU(sum2);
```
